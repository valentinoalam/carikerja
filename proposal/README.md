ðŸš€ Automating the Job Hunt: My Journey to Efficiency ðŸš€

Job searching can be exhausting, so I decided to channel my energy into making the process smarter, not harder. Over the past few weeks, Iâ€™ve been navigating the job market through Seek and receive email confirmations for each application I send out. Thatâ€™s when the idea struck â€“ why not automate tracking this journey?

So, I created a Google App Script that automatically updates my Google Sheet with all my applications every day at 6 AM. The script runs on a schedule, fetching email data and logging details like application dates, job titles, and company names. Itâ€™s been a game-changer for keeping track of progress without the constant manual updates. Sharing a snapshot of my job tracker here for inspiration! ðŸ“Š

But thatâ€™s not all. To make the application process more efficient for me and others, I also wrote a Python script that generates ATS-optimized resumes from the responses I receive from ChatGPT. This tool tailors resumes specifically for each job, ensuring better chances of getting noticed by recruiters.

I hope these tools can help my fellow job seekers out there. Feel free to reach out if you want tips, resources, or even help setting up your own tracker or resume builder. Letâ€™s make job hunting a bit less daunting and a lot more fun!
